# HTML5 Templates

This repository is full of my own HTML5 templates.   
Most of them were built using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) frameworks.   
Make sure you respect the license whilst copying, editing and redistributing any of the files.

Each template has a full resolution screenshot in it's root folder as well as a guide on how to set up a compiler for the used CSS3 pre-processor.
